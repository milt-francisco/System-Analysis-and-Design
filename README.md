# System-Analysis-and-Design

## Summary

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client desired a web application that could aid new drivers in obtaining their drivers license. Through online practice exams and in-person driving lessons, DriverPass aimed to target this audience with tools to excel in their goal.

### What did you do particularly well?
In this project, the diagrams I created were something I thought I did particularly well. While not extensive, I believe I created them well with the tools that were required.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One part I could improve upon is the original business document. After learning more through this course, I believe my revisions could benefit this document.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I followed the requirements closely to ensure the user receives the experience that DriverPass desires. It is important to consider the user's need when designing because if the design is poor, it could not retain an audience.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by adhering closely to the presented requirements. In the future, I believe communicating and understanding the client's desires will aid in designing new systems.
